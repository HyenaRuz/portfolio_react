          Hi! My name is Novruz, and Iâ€™m a front-end developer with a deep
          passion for creating interactive and visually appealing solutions. I
          started my journey into front-end development in 2023, and since then,
          Iâ€™ve been fully immersed in programming.
        </p>

        <p>
          I chose front-end because I love building things with my hands, and
          for me, itâ€™s the best way to visualize the creation process. My best
          project so far is the School management system, where I implemented
          data storage, a role system, and a responsive interface. In my
          opinion, the most beautiful project Iâ€™ve created is this portfolio
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to quality, I always aim for the best results within my
          capabilities and strive to learn new things along the way. In the
          future, I plan to master back-end development, mobile development, and
          explore other programming languages and frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m full of enthusiasm because Iâ€™m passionate about programming, I
          love the creative approach, and I enjoy solving complex challenges.
          Iâ€™m always open to new opportunities and challenges that help me grow
          as a developer.

          Hi! My name is Novruz, and Iâ€™m a front-end developer with a profound
          passion for crafting interactive and visually captivating solutions. I
          embarked on my journey into front-end development in 2023, and since
          then, Iâ€™ve been deeply immersed in the world of programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I gravitated towards front-end development due to my creative nature
          and my desire to challenge myself with complex and demanding tasks.
          The visual dimension of any product, whether itâ€™s a website or an
          application, truly enables my imagination to soar.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to quality, I consistently strive for excellence within
          my capabilities and am committed to continuous learning. I aspire to
          master back-end development, mobile development, and delve into other
          programming languages and frameworks. My biggest project to date is
          the School Management System, where I implemented data storage, a
          role-based access system, and a fully responsive interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m highly motivated and always open to new opportunities and
          challenges that foster my growth as a developer.
